XeroPathGenerator

This program is used by an FRC robotics team to generate paths
that are to be followed by the robot.  See the documentation in
the guide directory.

The program can be installed on a windows machine by executing
the xeropath.exe located here at the top most directory.

The program can be installed on a Mac OS machine by grabbing the
XeroPathGenerators.dmg, opening, and dragging the application bundle
to /Applications, your desktop, or whereever you want to have the
application.

The program can be installed on a Ubuntu 18.04 machine by grabbing
the xeropath.tar.bz2 and untarring to a desired install location.
Set your shell path to include the directory created by the untar
and then run xeropath.  This is a small shell script that sets up
the paths to the libraries before launching the executable.
