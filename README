XeroPathGenerator

This program is used by an FRC robotics team to generate paths
that are to be followed by the robot.  See the documentation in
the guide directory.

The program can be installed on a windows machine by executing
the xeropath.exe located here at the top most directory.

The program can be installed on a linux machine by untarring the
xeropath.tar in on disk and putting xeropathgen/bin in your path.

The Mac OS version is underway and will be ready soon.

To build this program under windows, you need the cygwin tools and
they must be stored at c:\cygwin64.  In addition the environment variable
VCINSTALLDIR must point at the directory above the redist directory to
find the microsoft redistributable components.  For instance, on my
build machine this is

C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Enterprise\VC
