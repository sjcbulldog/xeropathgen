XeroPathGenerator

This program is used by an FRC robotics team to generate paths
that are to be followed by the robot.  See the documentation in
the guide directory.

The program can be installed on a windows machine by executing
the xeropath.exe located here at the top most directory.

The program works under linux and i will have a version available
after i work through deployment issues.

The program woks under mac os and i will have a version available 
after i work through deloyment issues.

To build this program under windows, you need the cygwin tools and
they must be stored at c:\cygwin64.  In addition the environment variable
VCINSTALLDIR must point at the directory above the redist directory to
find the microsoft redistributable components.  For instance, on my
build machine this is

C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Enterprise\VC

Note it bulds with visual studio 2019.
