XeroPathGenerator

This program is used by an FRC robotics team to generate paths
that are to be followed by the robot.  See the documentation in
the guide directory.

Note, the program can be installed on a windows machine by executing
the xeropath.exe located here at the top most directory.

This application is built using Qt meaning it is portable to both
Mac OS and Linux.  This work has not been done yet.
