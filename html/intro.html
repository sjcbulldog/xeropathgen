    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    One of the big challenges in FRC robotics is the autonomous mode.  This is the 15 second time period at the
    start of a match where the robot must be 100% controlled by software.  Within autonomous, moving the robot to
    a desired location is a big part of the challenge.  To date, the best approach for doing this is some form of
    path following algorithm.  Path following is exactly what is sounds like it should be.  A path is defined and
    the robot does its best to follow the path.  Generally, the path is defined on a computer and then downloaded
    to the robot.  The robot follows the path using a follower algorithm.  There are several types of follower
    algorithms and it is not the intent of this document to get into these algorithms here.  What is key is that
    these following algorithms either want the waypoints along the path as input, or they want some type of periodic
    information describing the behavior of the robot drivebase.  The XeroPathGenerator was written to provide a
    powerful and flexible application to generate these paths.<br><br>
    Another goal of this program was to provide information to help teach students about path following.  To
    that end, this program shows plots of the generated velocity profile for the path.  This program can also
    run in demo mode, showing the motion of the robot.  Finally, when running in demo mode, the program can show a
    rough diagram of the forces acting on the robot. <br><br>
    The XeroPathGenerator was written to be easy to extend.  There are two key extensions that are possible. New
    game fields can be added to the program by providing a graphics image for the field and a JSON file describing
    the field.  This format is identical to the format used by the First provided path editing software
    (FRC Path Weaver).  Generators can be added by adding a new executable program that reads path description and
    robot descriptions, and outputs trajectories.  This new executable is accompanied by a JSON file describing the
    generator. The program ships with the PowerUp field and the Deep Space field.<br><br>
    The program ships with the PathFinder V1 can be found in github (https://github.com/JacisNonsense/Pathfinder).
    It also ships with a backend generator known as XeroGen which was created for this application, but leans heavily
    on ideas, concept, and algorithms from Cheesy Poofs. The program supports tank drive and swerve drive style drive
    bases.  Error Code Xero is actively building a swerve drive as a summer project, but as of the writing of this
    document, it is not ready for test of this code by software.  Therefore, all swerve drive support is very
    experimental and has not been tested on a real robot yet. As of this point, this program is very much an alpha
    release.  Do not rely on this for a competition robot until it has had more testing by more people.  All feedback
    is welcome.
