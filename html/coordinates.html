    <h1>Coordinates</h1>
    Anytime we are dealing with the location of the robot, there is a coordinate system used
    as a reference.  The XeroPathGenerator uses and X/Y coordinate system with the origin at
    the lower left-hand corner of the field.  The X axis increases left to right along the
    long edge of the field, and the Y axis increases top to bottom along the short edge of
    the field.  The heading is measured in degrees.  Zero degrees heading is looking in the
    direction of the positive X axis.  Ninety degrees heading is looking in the direction
    of the Y axis.
