        When the program is first started, no robot is defined.  The
        program will prompt you to create a robot.  Creating a robot
        consists of describing the physical attributes of the robot.
        This includes the width, length, maximum velocity, maximum
        acceleration, maximum jerk, drive type, and the timestep for
        the robot control loop controlling the drive base.  Note,
        additional robots can be defined at any time via the Robots/New
        Robot menu item.  Robots may also be deleted via the Robots/Delete
        Robot menu item.

                While you can select the Swerve Drive type, all support for swerve is 
                experimental.  It will likely not work at this point in time.
