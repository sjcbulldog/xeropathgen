    <h3>Waypoint</h3>
    A waypoint describes the location and orientation of the robot.  It is represented by an X and Y coordinate as well as a heading angle.
    <h3>Path</h3>A path is a set of waypoints that describe the desired path of travel for the robot.
    <h3>Path Group</h3> A path group is a set of paths grouped together.  While these paths can be grouped based on any organization,
    generally path groups are intended to describe a single autonomous mode.
    <h3>Velocity</h3> This is the speed of the robot, measured in distance per time.
    <h3>Acceleration</h3> This is the change in speed of the robot per unit time, measured in distance per time squared.
    <h3>Jerk</h3> This is the change in acceleration of the robot per unit time, measured in distance per time cubed.
    <h3>Trajectory Point</h3> A trajectory point describes the position, velocity, acceleration, and jerk for a single entity (robot, wheel, etc.) at specific point in time.
    <h3>Trajectory</h3> A trajectory is a set of trajectory points that describe a path for an entity to follow.  These points are usually provided at a fixed time or distance, but that is not a requirement.
