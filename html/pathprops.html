        The path properties window is a property editor window just below the Path File window.
        This property editor provides a way for the properties associated with a path to be
        changed.  The following properties are available.

        <br>
        <table>
             <tr>
                <th>Name</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Start Velocity</td>
                <td>The starting velocity of the robot when this path is started.  This allows two paths to be concatenated with the robot in motion. </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>End Velocity</td>
                <td>The ending velocity of the robot when the path is complete.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Max Velocity</td>
                <td>The maximum velocity of the robot when executing this path. </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Max Acceleration</td>
                <td>The maximum acceleration of the robot when executing this path. </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Max Jerk</td>
                <td>The maximum jerk of the robot when executing this path.  Not all path generators honor this value.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Start Angle</td>
                <td>For swerve drive only, this is the angle the robot is facing at the start of the path.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Start Angle Delay</td>
                <td>
                    For swerve drive only, this is the delay from the start of the path before the robot starts to rotate to the desired end angle.
                    This value gives the robot time to clear any obstructions before trying to rotate.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>End Angle</td>
                <td>For swerve drive only, this is the angle the robot is facing at the end of the path.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>End Angle Delay</td>
                <td>
                    For swerve drive only, this is the delay from the end of the path when the robot much reach the end angle.
                    This prevents the robot from trying to complete a rotation as it approaches and obstruction.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Length</td>
                <td>This property is read only and display the length of the path in the user’s chosen distance units.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Time</td>
                <td>This property is read only and displays the time of the path in seconds.</td>
            </tr>
