        The flags window provides a way to add flags to a path.  A flag is signal to the robot
        software that that the robot is between a give range of positions along a path.  For instance, you 
        may activate a flag at the halfway point of a path to start lifting an elevator so
        that it is at the desired height when the end of the path is reached.<br><br>
        This path generation program just provides a way for flags to be specified as a function of 
        distance along a path.  Then a flags file is generated that maps the flags to times along the
        path.<br><br>
        It is up to the robot code to read the flags file and process the flags accordingly.
        Error Code Xero has a flags manager and "wait for flags" actions that are used to manage
        flags within the robot code.
