        Selecting the path in the Path File window will cause the path to be displayed in 
        the Path Editing window.  Each new path starts at the origin (0, 0) and extends 
        right 100 inches.  To edit the path, grab the first waypoint at the origin and 
        move it to a new location on the field.  To make fine adjustments for a path location, 
        either use the arrow keys (with shift down for really fine adjustments), or type the 
        coordinates desired in the waypoint window.  Insert new waypoints using the insert key. 
        Note as the path is edited, the trajectory window will update after a small delay with 
        the updated trajectory.
