        Finally, to generate paths, use the File/Generate (or file Generate As)
        menu item.  This will generate a set of trajectory files in the chosen directory.
        Several files will be generated for each path.  Each of these files will contain
        the name of the path group, the name of the path, and the target element for the
        output file.  Target elements include the robot, and for a tank drive, the left
        and right motors.  For a serve drive, a trajectory file is generated for the main
        robot and each of the four wheels.

                While you can select the Swerve Drive type, all support for swerve is
                experimental.  It will likely not work at this point in time.
