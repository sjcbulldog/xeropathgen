        The cursor and scrollbar are used to identify locations along a path.  This is 
        especially useful for finding specific distances along the path for distance 
        constraints.  There are three areas of note highlighted in the picture above.  
        First, on the path in the Path Editing window the robot current position is 
        highlighted with a simple robot image. The scroll bar along the bottom is used 
        to move the robot cursor along the path.  Grab and move the scroll bar to see 
        the robot cursor move.  Finally, in the status bar, the current time and 
        distance for the path is displayed.
