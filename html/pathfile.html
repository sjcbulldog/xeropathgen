    The path file window is in the upper right side of the application (highlighted here in red). 
    It is a twolevel display with the list of elements at the top level being the set of
    Path Groups.  The elements below Path Groups are the Paths.  Selecting a specific Path 
    causes the path to be displayed in the Path View window and causes the Trajectory Profile 
    to be displayed in the Trajectory Profile window.
