        The path editing window is used the edit path.  When a path is selected
        in the Path File window, the path is displayed in the path editing window.
        Here, individual waypoints can be selected with the left mouse button.
        Selected waypoints can be moved by dragging the waypoint with the left mouse
        button down.  Finally, a waypoint can be rotated by dragging the yellow rotation
        circle attached to a selected waypoint and moving the mouse around the waypoint.
