        The trajectory window is located below the Path Editing window when the 
        Trajectory tab is selected.  This shows the generated trajectory for the 
        currently selected path.  There are many different variables that can be 
        displayed and these are selected by the View/Plot Variables menu item.  
        By default, the position, velocity, and acceleration of the robot are 
        displayed.
        <br />
        The left mouse button can be used to zoom in on a specific area of the
        trajectory window.
